Got it 👍 I see your current table UI with Device Name, BD_ADDR, and Procedures (Pair / Connect buttons). Right now it looks functional but a bit raw. Here are some improvements you could apply:

⸻

Visual/UI Improvements
	1.	Column alignment & spacing
	•	Increase spacing between columns so that Device Name, BD_ADDR, and Procedures don’t feel cramped.
	•	Left-align Device Name, center-align BD_ADDR, and right-align buttons.
	2.	Highlighting & readability
	•	Alternate row colors (zebra striping) for better readability.
	•	Highlight a row when hovered/selected.
	3.	Column headers
	•	Add bold headers with a contrasting background (e.g., light grey/blue).
	•	Use consistent capitalization: Device Name, BD Address, Procedures.
	4.	Device name truncation
	•	Long device names (like “OnePlus Nord CE…”) get cut off. Instead:
	•	Use ellipsis (...) with tooltip on hover to show full name.
	•	Or allow column resizing.
	5.	Icons instead of text (optional)
	•	Use a 🔗 (connect) icon for connect, and a 🔒 (lock) for pair.
	•	Hover tooltip: “Connect” / “Pair”.

Feature Improvements
	1.	Status indicator
	•	Show connection status with a small colored dot (🟢 connected, 🔴 disconnected, 🟡 pairing).
	2.	Sorting/Filtering
	•	Allow sorting by Device Name or BD_ADDR.
	•	Option to filter by “Paired Devices only” or “Available Devices”.
	3.	Batch operations
	•	Add checkboxes so multiple devices can be paired/connected at once.
	4.	Context menu (right-click)
	•	Options like Pair, Connect, Disconnect, Unpair could be added to a right-click menu.
	5.	Signal strength (RSSI)
	•	If possible, show RSSI value (signal bars 📶) beside devices.
