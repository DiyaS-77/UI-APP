Thanks for sharing your updated UI 👀. It looks cleaner than the earlier one, but there are still areas where you can make it look more polished and user-friendly. Here are some improvements you could try:

⸻

🎨 Visual Enhancements
	1.	Song Info Section
	•	Add album art/thumbnail next to Title–Artist–Album details.
	•	Bold the title and keep artist/album in a smaller, lighter font for hierarchy.
	2.	Playback Buttons
	•	Replace text buttons (Play, Pause, Next, Previous, Rewind) with icon buttons (▶️ ⏸️ ⏭️ ⏮️ ⏪).
	•	Make them circular and evenly spaced in a single row.
	3.	Progress Bar
	•	Use a modern progress slider with a colored track (e.g., blue/green) and a rounded handle.
	•	Place time elapsed (00:01) and total duration (01:19) on either side (like you did, but more aligned and balanced).
	4.	Volume Control
	•	Add a speaker icon (🔊) before the slider.
	•	Show percentage (100%) dynamically next to the slider in smaller text.
	5.	Device Control Buttons (Connect / Disconnect / Unpair)
	•	Style them differently from playback controls.
	•	For example:
	•	Connect → Green button
	•	Disconnect → Red button
	•	Unpair → Neutral/Gray button
	6.	Overall Layout
	•	Add rounded card-style containers around sections (Media info, Controls, Device management).
	•	Use subtle shadows or gradients so that it doesn’t feel flat.
